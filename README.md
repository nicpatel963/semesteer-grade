# semesteer-grade
a windows application in C# to determine a course letter grade, semester average, and a semester letter grade, based on the user input of course numeric grades.
Your company’s last project went well, so the client has referred another client, a school. You have now been assigned the responsibility to create a windows application in C# to determine a course letter grade, semester average, and a semester letter grade, based on the user input of course numeric grades.
Your solution will take a numeric grade as input for each of six courses, for a single semester. Once a grade is input, and the user moves off the input text box, a letter grade will be determined for that specific course. Once the grades for all six courses have been entered the user will click a button and the program will calculate the semester’s overall average and letter grade.
As well, once the semester calculation has been completed, the solution will not allow the user to strike the enter key or input any more data until the form is Reset/Cleared.
The solution should also allow the user to exit the program regardless of the state of the form, in other words. The user can exit at any time.
